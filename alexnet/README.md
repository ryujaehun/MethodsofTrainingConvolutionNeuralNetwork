## about

>AlexNet is the name of a [convolutional neural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) network, originally written with [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) to run with [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU) support, which competed in the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge) in 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points ahead of the runner up. AlexNet was designed by the SuperVision group, consisting of Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ilya Sutskever. -wikipedia


## architecture

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists
of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers,
and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training
faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation
of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected
layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout”
that proved to be very effective.

## TODO

* ~~apply another optimizer~~
* ~~apply tensorboard~~
* ~~Fit to a GPU~~
* ~~Application of the technique to the paper~~
* Eliminate bottlenecks
* Update other models(Modilenet,Squeezenet,Densenet,etc..)


## file_architecture

```
ILSVRC 2012 training set folder should be srtuctured like this:
		ILSVRC2012_img_train
			|_n01440764
			|_n01443537
			|_n01484850
			|_n01491361
			|_ ...
```    

#### you must untar training file `untar.sh`


## download

[download LSVRC 2012 image data file](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/nonpub-downloads)


## Remove log

If you do not want to see the log at startup
train.py line 97, remove `allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=True`
